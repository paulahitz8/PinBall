**List of differences**

- Music and audio effects
- No pop ups with questions about fire emergencies
- Different animations
- We have less bumpers
- We added a score and lives
- We deleted the water tube

Disclaimer: we did not find the original sound files, we could not separate sound effects from the background music. We cannot grab animations since the original game zooms in and moves the camera constantly.
